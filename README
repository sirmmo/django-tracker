Django-tracker is a simple Django application that enables the realtime sending of 
information to the users of a webpage through a simple jabber client.

The architecture is this: 

Your server ==json==> Proxy ==> pubsub ==> Web Clients

The system was tested on eJabberd and works seamlessly

in next versions the pre-binding should be added.
